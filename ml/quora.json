And seeing that the cats and our place were all fine, I didn\u2019t make a big deal out of it.\n\n\u201cHave you heard about Bitcoin?\u201d he told me.\n\n\u201cBit-what?!\u201d\n\nSo I read the white paper [ https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf ].\n\nI was a mergers & acquisitions lawyer at the time.\n\nAttorneys make whole careers based on the premise that you can never prove that something happens. They bend and twist the truth in the way that most suits the needs of their clients.\n\nBut this blockchain, it was something else.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time in history we can verify that something happened at a definitive point in time without depending on an intermediary,\u201d I thought.\n\nUntil then, records of transactions had to be kept with a 3rd party and would be suspect to tampering. But with blockchain, trust is safely spread out.\n\nAnother way to look at is by understanding the Byzantine Generals\u2019 Problem. Several armies surround a city. If they all attack at the same time, they can triumph. If they all retreat at the same time, they can save themselves.\n\nBut anything in between, and there\u2019ll be death. A lot of it.\n\nIt\u2019s the fundemantal human problem of trust. One general can tell the others that he\u2019ll be attacking, but they can\u2019t know it for a fact until they themselves either attack or retreat.\n\nBlockchain, on the other hand, is a public ledger recording transactions with timestamps on a vastly distributed network of computers. If one person decides to tell a different story, they won\u2019t be able to.\n\nToo many records on too many nodes will prevent that.\n\nRevolutionary.\n\nBlockchain naysayers aren\u2019t rare.\n\nWhen email was invented, they said it\u2019s too impersonal and people would never use it. Phone companies used to state that no one would ever communicate over anything but a phone line. Traditional media believed banner ads wouldn't be effective in comparison with printed ads.\n\nThey were all wrong.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the point.\n\nBlockchain is already powering technologies that are transforming our lives [ https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/01/22/35-amazing-real-world-examples-of-how-blockchain-is-changing-our-world/2/#c1171d512328 ].\n\nIn healthcare, it\u2019s being used to track the progress of patients after they leave the hospital.

His mother is not well and admitted in the hospital he wants some money immediately for the operation, he calls you and says, \u201cY, I need some money. I have run out of it.\u201d\nYou reply, \u201cSending some right away,\u201d and hung up.You then call your account manager at your bank and tell him, \u201cPlease transfer $1000 from my account to X's account.\u201d\nYour account manager replies, \u201cOK, sir.\u201d\nHe opens up the register, checks your account balance to see if you have enough balance to transfer $1000 to X. Because you have plenty thus, he makes an entry in your account like the following:\nY --%3E $1000 to X\nYou call X and tell him, \u201cI\u2019ve transferred the money. \u201c\nWhat just happened? You and X both trusted the bank to manage your money. There was no real movement of physical things to transfer the money. All that was needed was an entry in the register. The entry in that register that neither you nor X controls or owns.\nAnd this is the problem of the current systems.\nTo establish trust between ourselves, we depend on individual third-parties from so many years.\n* What if that register in which the transaction was logged gets burnt in a fire?\n* What if, by mistake, your account manager had written $1200 instead of $1000?\n* What if he did that intentionally?\n* Could there be a system where we can still transfer money without needing the bank?\nThink about it for a second, what does transferring money means? Just an entry in the register. Is there a way to maintain the register among ourselves instead of someone else does it for us?\nThe blockchain is the answer to the profound question It is a method to maintain that register among ourselves instead of depending on someone else to do it for us.\nThe requirement of this method is that there must be enough people who would like not to depend on a third-party then only this group can maintain the register on their own.\nWe will assume four individuals who upon mutual agreement, have details of each other\u2019s accounts all the time without knowing the other\u2019s identity.\nFirst, they all have an empty folder having pages with themselves to start with. These pages will keep the record of all the transactions.Whenever a transaction happens, everyone in the network writes about the details of the transaction.Suppose the third member is sending $10 to the first one then to make the transaction, third shouts and tells everyone so that everyone makes a note of it on their pages.\nEveryone checks whether third member has enough balance to transfer $10 first. If she has enough balance, everyone then makes a note of the transaction on their blank pages Now, transaction among them continuous in the same way. This exercise continues until everyone runs out of space on the current page.When a page gets filled its time to put the page away in the folder and bring out a new page and repeat the process from the step above.\nBefore we put away the page in our folders, we need to seal it with a unique key that everyone in the network agrees upon. It is called mining by mining it, we will make sure that no one can make any changes to it once its copies have been put away in everyone\u2019s folder. That is why it is called as the decentralized system.",

            "text": "A blockchain [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain_(database) ], or distributed ledger, is mostly known for the first technology it enabled, the Bitcoin [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin ], which Satoshi Nakamoto  [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto ]first described in a paper in 2008 [ https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf ].\n\nI will try to provide a general overview of the technology and its potential, from both practical and technical perspectives, which you should be able to understand without any previous knowledge on the blockchain.\n\nToday, cryptocurrencies in circulation alone have a market capitalisation of well over ten billion dollars and new start-ups relying on the blockchain are funded every day, fulfilling the thirst of venture capitalists for the technology. What blockchain promises to solve is a long-standing computer science issue discussed since the early 1970\u2019s and generalised in 1982 as the Byzantine Generals\u2019 Problem [ http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/byz.pdf ] which essentially asks how multiple cooperating parties can reach common knowledge  [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_(logic) ]about a factual element when there exists some malicious actors actively trying to spread incorrect information and who have a certain likelihood of intercepting and altering every direct communication between individuals. Until now, this problem would usually be addressed by relying on a trusted central authority, but for the first time, blockchain allows any such consensus to be reached without having to place trust in any single entity. Much has been written on the societal changes blockchain will bring, the challenges governments will need to address or even how a new body of law, Lex Cryptographia [ https://www.intgovforum.org/cms/wks2015/uploads/proposal_background_paper/SSRN-id2580664.pdf ], will be needed to adjust to this new paradigm.\n\nTechnical Overview\n\nBlockchain\u2019s solution to the Byzantine Generals\u2019 Problem is to impose to every actor who wants to share some information to also solve a very complex mathematical puzzle (called block) that proves a large amount of work has been invested. Thanks to complex mathematical properties, it is possible to design problems that are hard to compute, but easy to verify; this is actually the reverse of the popular concept of asymmetric keys encryption [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography ] in the field of cryptography, which powers most modern secured communication protocols and in which we want to generate puzzles that are easy to compute (creating the key) but hard to verify (cracking the key). Each block contains a hash (a string of characters), that has to refer cryptographically to the hash of the previous block (to guarantee the chronological order). Together, this serie of blocks, up to the genesis block (the only block hardcoded into the blockchain\u2019s core script), form the blockchain. The computational difficulty of generating a valid block mostly stems from the randomness of the process of finding a new hash that will correctly connect to the hash of the previous block.\n\nA copy of the blockchain database (of about 80 gigabytes today for the Bitcoin blockchain, but continuously growing as more blocks are appended) as well as the core script that contains the rules of what should be considered a valid blockchain are stored on every computer (called full node) that is willing to be part of the network. In addition to the hash, each block stores a large amount of information (called transactions). Anyone who wants to get information stored in the database can do so by querying from any node of the network; if some nodes disagree on what should be the correct state of the blockchain, one will always trust the longest valid blockchain (i.e. the full node that can prove his version of the blockchain required more computational effort than all the other existing versions), which honest nodes will actively be searching for to replace their own version of the chain. It is also possible that multiple blockchain temporarily have the same length, in which case one has to wait until further blocks are added to be able to distinguish which version of the blockchain one should trust. As a general rule, the older a block is in the chain, the more trustworthy it is, because an attacker would have to start and re-create a much larger fraction of the blockchain to replace it.\n\nMost individuals who want to add some transactions into the blockchain do not have the computing power or the time necessary to find a valid block. In that case, they will add their transaction into a pool of unconfirmed transactions that are waiting for a professional block generator (called a miner) to find a block for them. When a miner finds a valid block, which is a really rare event, he will include in it as many transactions as the block allows for (currently one megabyte for the bitcoin blockchain) and broadcast it to all the full nodes of the blockchain, that will append the block to the chain after having checked its validity. In most blockchains, when a miner successfully adds a block to the chain, he receives a reward from the system as well a fee perceived from the individuals whose transaction has been included (optional, normally only included when there is a congestion of unconfirmed transactions, to help miners prioritise which transaction to include first).\n\nThe underlying assumption of the process is that the total effort invested by honest miners is greater than the total effort invested by those with malicious intents. By effort, one should understand money, since computational difficulty directly relates to electricity and hardware costs. Each individual involved in the process owns a public and a private key. Your public key identifies you and can be used by anyone to see what contributions you have made to the blockchain (e.g. how much money you possess in the case of a cryptocurrency blockchain). Using your private key, you can generate transactions that are cryptographically guaranteed to originate from you. By this process, even if a malicious actor were to control a majority of the blockchain\u2019s computing power, its power, through what is called a 51% attack, would be limited to cancelling recent transactions and blocking new transactions from occurring; stealing money from other accounts is impossible without knowing the private key of the targeted individuals. That way, by limiting the incentives for malicious actors to harm the system and creating strong rewards for people to reinforce the system, we make the blockchain an extremely reliable decentralised ledger. So far, no such attack has ever been successful.\n\nModern uses & potential\n\nThe blockchain can be used in a large variety of applications. As of today however, the most widespread use of blockchains remains limited to cryptocurrencies, or more famously the bitcoin. It is only recently, with the introduction of the Ethereum  [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum ]network in July 2015, two years after being described in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 [ https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper ], that serious alternatives were made possible. The main innovation of the Ethereum was to introduce a Turing-complete [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness ] programming language that supports all basic operations necessary to implement any algorithm, allowing to manipulate the Ethereum blockchain easily. These new kind of applications, powered by the Ethereum or similar blockchains, are what I will call the modern uses of the blockchain, as opposed to the traditional usage generally limited to digital currencies. In general, most of the value of the blockchain can be summarised in getting rid of the intermediaries, whether they are banks, lawyers or any entity, thus dramatically reducing agency and coordination costs.\n\n1. Digital currencies and payment systems. While traditionally done through the Bitcoin network, payment systems will probably remain the main use of the blockchain for a few more years. With the introduction of better blockchains such as the Ethereum (which also supports payment systems), distributed digital payments are increasingly made easier, faster and cheaper. Through the blockchain, businesses could get rid of transaction fees, which often consume a large fraction of the margins in the retail industry, and automate payments without depending on banks. Such payment systems would be especially valuable in developing markets or countries with unstable currencies\n2. Online Privacy. Today, a factor that slows down technology adoption for many individuals, corporations or governments is privacy concerns and the fear of handing out too much control to other entities. But the blockchain would allow everybody to take advantage of new technologies, such as cloud storage of personal biometric information, while maintaining complete control over their data, even from governments, due to cryptographic encryption. This would be of great value for example for corporations who focus on selling hardware or services, such as Walmart or even Apple, but of lesser value to corporations whose value creation reside in owning data, such as Google and Facebook.\n3. Smart contracts. They can be considered as the building block of modern blockchain applications. Smart contracts [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract ] are self-executing agreements written in code instead of words and enforced by the blockchain instead of courts. Blockchains that support external scripting, such as Ethereum, generally make the implementation of such contracts very easy with only a few lines of code.\n\nMost traditional contracts could potentially be partially or fully implemented in a smart contract. The more objective the evaluation of the outcome is, the easier it is to draft such a contract. A classic example would be an online advertising agency selling search engine optimisation services, with the promise that the client\u2019s website will appear on the first page of a specified search engine for a given keyword within 30 days. Such services generally appear very suspicious because they are often provided on the web by unknown companies based in a foreign country, but an example implementation of such a contract only requires a few rules:\n\n- Start contract when both parties have sent agreed bitcoin amount to account managed by the smart contract (stored in the blockchain). If no amount is received within 7 days, cancel contract and send back all money received.\n\n- After 30 days, check the search engine\u2019s URL that corresponds to the selected keyword. If given website is in the URL\u2019s source code, send all the money of the contract\u2019s account to the agency; otherwise, send it all back to the customer (including the penalty for failed execution).\n\nMore advanced and larger scale contracts can easily take place, especially in the financial sector where trust plays a central role and allows intermediaries to justify hefty commissions in all trades. A multisignature escrow account, futures contract, any financial derivative or commodity trading with completely eliminated counterparty risk can be implemented just as easily using a similar stratagem; here the trust would be reduced to one agent only: the stock exchange that publicly displays the stock prices on its website, used as the source of truth when the contract triggers the settlement. \n\nSmart contracts not only eliminate enforcement costs, they also get rid of ambiguity and make all business dealings instantaneous: if a specified condition is met, the blockchain immediately releases the fund and all other digital assets as specified by the contract.\n4. Smart property, also known as colored coins [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colored_coins ]. Pushing the limits even further, the blockchain allows for cryptographically activated assets. Those could be either physical or digital and would take the form of a token; whoever possesses the token, which can be easily exchanged and transferred like any other digital currency, owns the asset. Those assets could be real estate (e.g. a house whose door only opens to people in possession of the token), objects (e.g. diamonds whose transactions are only recognized by governments if sold with a valid token, reducing trafficking and making it easier to verify their authenticity) or intellectual property (e.g. patent ownership that can be traced back to the entity owning the patent\u2019s token, or music royalties that are sent automatically to the owner of the token associated with the rights to the songs). \n\nSome of these systems would require full support from the government as it currently manages most of the existing ledgers, e.g. land registries that often require a lengthy and costly administrative procedure to access or to change, often necessitating the services of a notary in case of a sale. But the private sector will play a key role in defining how those evolutions take place and, potentially, whether it can take over some of these functions that used to require the government\u2014a trusted central authority\u2014but can now be handed over to the blockchain.\n5. Decentralised name registration. A natural extension to smart property is decentralized name registration: the first individual to add a certain name to the blockchain, if it did not exist already, receives \u201cownership\u201d of that name. This could be used to manage internet domain names, traditionally a responsibility of registry operators [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registry ] who owned a monopoly on a specific top level domain (e.g. Verisign  [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verisign ]for the .com). In the case of domain names, the blockchain could require from individuals to pay a yearly fee to maintain ownership, which would be used to cover mining costs or would be sent automatically to the government as a tax.\n\nWe could further generalise the registration of names to more abstract concepts such as texts, images, videos or even ideas: the first to submit automatically gains ownership of intellectual property.\n6. Decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs). When smart contracts are bundled together, they can sometimes form what is called a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization ]. While there is not yet a formally agreed upon definition of the concept, DAOs can be understood as regular organisations except that, instead of following the lead of human managers, they have an automated governance encoded in smart contracts. The most famous implementation of a DAO was the venture capital fund sobrely called The DAO [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization) ] that (despite later issues that led to its shut down) raised over a hundred million USD over a crowdfunding campaign in May 2016. Contrary to traditional funds, shareholders of The DAO do not elect a board to represent them but are directly involved in the operational activities and investment decisions.\n\nWikipedia is a perfect example of organisation that could have benefited from the blockchain. Its organisational structure is really close to that of a DAO, with most of its content being generated by its community and all decisions being made through a democratic process. Yet, without the blockchain, the Wikimedia Foundation had to rely on a few individuals to manage the organisation, such as the executive director, vested with special powers. This creates conflicts of interest, even within a non-profit. A Wikipedia DAO could easily be implemented, thus removing the need for human representatives and making Wikipedia truly neutral and independent.\n\nSimilarly to smart contracts, not even its creators can control a DAO once deployed in the blockchain (unless special provisions have been written in the initial code). Large networks of DAOs could grow to become artificially intelligent clusters of computer programmes with control over physical assets, similarly to how machine learning neural networks [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network ] work, bringing us a bit closer to the technological singularity [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity ].\nCosts and risks\n\n1. Reduced control. The blockchain is attractive for its unmatched level of security. You can trust it to protect the integrity of your data more than you would trust any bank or government. But it will do so indiscriminately and will not protect you from your own mistakes. Once a smart contract is released into the blockchain, no one can stop it, not even you. If by mistake you forgot to add a clause that indicates where to send the funds back when the contract is cancelled, the money will stay forever lost in the blockchain. Worse, if you design a harmful contract that incentivises illegal behavior (e.g. by automatically remunerating individuals who publish terrorist content) and equip it with large financial resources, neither remorse nor an injunction will be of any effect to stop it.\n2. Latency. The blockchain is not as reactive as traditional databases. This is the cost to pay for security: for each block and each transaction we add, the nodes need to run many time-consuming checks that insure they comply with the rules defined by the core script. In addition, many blockchains artificially adjust the level of \u201cdifficulty\u201d of the mining to make sure the blockchain doesn\u2019t grow too fast. In the bitcoin for example, a new block is only added about every ten minutes, which is why transactions take a few minutes on average to be confirmed. Recent blockchains such as Ethereum have been able to decrease that delay to about fifteen seconds between each block, but that remains far too slow for real-time applications.\n3. Storage costs. One of the fundamental properties of the blockchain is that it has to conserve the full history of the transactions and thus will forever grow over time. In addition, its distributed nature requires thousands of nodes to make copies of the entire blockchain, and to store it on a well connected computer with a high bandwidth. As a result, storage costs are thousands of times higher than any other solution, making it largely impractical at the moment to store more than a few bytes of text, let alone images or videos.\n4. Mining costs and risks. Mining represents the majority of the costs in traditional blockchains that rely on a Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm, such as the Bitcoin. As explained earlier, the blockchain makes it artificially difficult to create a new block (thus very costly in electricity and hardware) to protect the network from 51% attacks. The drawback is that to provide a decent level of security, indecent amounts of electricity need to be wasted, which is not only expensive but also leaves a terrible environmental footprint. At the current value of the bitcoin, a few million dollars worth of electricity are consumed every day by bitcoin miners alone. \n\nThe theoretical foundations of PoW incentives stem from game theory [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory ]: if the rewards for a successful attack are lower than the costs, no rational individual should attempt an attack. As we saw, the rewards for a successful attack are limited as it is impossible to steal money without also knowing the private key of individuals. As for the costs, with PoW they come from two components: the initial investment (to acquire the necessary hardware) and the electricity. The cost of controlling the network will be proportional to the duration of the attack, as the attacker has to keep finding valid blocks faster than the honest nodes to maintain its blockchain longer than the honest blockchain. But with the recent advances in cloud computing, it has become cheap to rent a large CPU capacity for a very short period of time with little upfront investment. In addition, economies of scale and geographic differences in electricity and hardware prices have created strong incentives for miners to pool their resources, making the system more vulnerable. \n\nBlockchains can remunerate miners for their effort either by generating new currency or by perceiving a fee on each transaction. The former will create inflation and is thus equivalent to a \u201cwealth tax [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_tax ]\u201d (since each coin loses a fraction of its value), whereas the latter is equivalent to a \u201cvalue added tax [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_tax ]\u201d (or \u201cfinancial transaction tax [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_transaction_tax ]\u201d); both kinds of taxation have been active topics of research in public policy for a long time and have well-understood advantages and inconvenients. There is also a trade-off between the desired level of security and the cost of running the blockchain, thus incentive levels might have to be adjusted depending on the criticality of the infrastructure. \n\nA promising alternative to PoW is Proof-of-Stake (PoS). With PoS, the network is protected as long as honest participants own at least 51% of all the assets at stake. Here, the incentive system has to be built in a way that makes anyone who successfully carries an attack lose as much wealth as possible. Many variations of PoS have been suggested, such as the Casper algorithm [ https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/08/01/introducing-casper-friendly-ghost/ ] \u2014expected to replace PoW in Ethereum soon\u2014, in which individuals can \u201cbet\u201d coins on which block they believe will be added to the blockchain next. In such cases, the only circumstances in which participants will make non-hedgeable losses at betting is if the network is successfully attacked: this very low probability event is similar to a \u201csystematic risk [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_risk ]\u201d in finance, and the gains made on successful bets can be compared to the \u201crisk-free [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk-free_interest_rate ]\u201d return offered by government bonds. Just as for government bonds, all participants in such a blockchain should invest all their \u201cassets\u201d into the \u201cbetting\u201d to gain the \u201crisk-free\u201d return unless they are too risk-averse to agree to increase their exposure to the \u201csystematic risk\u201d (to which they are exposed anyway whether they bet or not). \n\nWe can actually show that consensus-by-bet PoS can be modelled as a subset of PoW [ https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/08/07/on-public-and-private-blockchains/ ] displaying similar mining incentives except that the cost of carrying a successful attack against the network is not proportional to the duration of the attack but roughly constant (since your stake is likely to lose most of its value if you attack the network). This is a desirable property as the social cost of an attack is generally better represented by a fixed value than by a linear function of time. Assuming that most cryptocurrencies owners participate in the betting process, it also makes it easy to raise the cost of an attack to billions of dollars instead of millions. PoW also practically eliminates electricity consumption and, incidentally, makes possible several improvements to raise the speed of the network.\n\nNote that if financial instruments allowing speculators to take highly leveraged short positions on the blockchain exist (for example by shorting the stock of companies that have invested heavily in the technology), attackers will start having financial incentives to take the network down.\n5. Sybil attacks. Another less discussed vulnerability of the blockchain is its full nodes. If copies of the entire blockchain are not stored on enough computers, attackers can potentially fill the network with clients controlled by them and partially take down the system through what is called a Sybil attack [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack ]. Malicious nodes are only problematic if they are so prominent that finding honest nodes becomes too time consuming, thus it is required to control much more than half of the network to inflict a generalised failure.\n\nIncreasing the mining incentives will not necessarily improve the protection against sybil attacks, but a certain number of measures are generally put in place to make these attacks difficult, such as limiting the number of outbound connections per ip address. So far, blockchains have never really lacked of full nodes so research efforts have been concentrated in other areas. If sybil vulnerabilities become critical (for example because hosting full becomes too costly), it might be necessary to provide financial incentives to people running full nodes.\n6. Mitigation and recovery. While vulnerability to attacks and to human mistakes are a major weakness of the blockchain, recent events have shown that possibilities of mitigation play a huge role in the credibility of the system, in particular with regards to forking, which can sometimes allow an almost full recovery of lost or stolen funds.\n\nIn June 2016, a vulnerability in the smart contracts behind The DAO allowed a hacker to steal over fifty million dollars from the fund. While this was not due to a failure of the Ethereum blockchain but only to the bad implementation of The DAO, the losses were of such large scale that they would strongly affect the Ethereum and put its survival at risk if nothing was done. The DAO had become a too big to fail  [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_big_to_fail ]financial institution that Ethereum (the \u201cState\u201d of this microeconomy) had to bail it out. Ethereum\u2019s core developers thus released a patch that would essentially invalidate all the stolen funds, correct the vulnerability and bring back the Ethereum to its state just before the attack.\n\nWhen a communication failure between nodes occurs or when only part of the nodes update their core script, the blockchain may split into two distinct versions. This is what we call a fork. Most of the time, forks are only temporary and disappear once all the nodes are synchronised. But sometimes, they come from a conscious decision from one part of the community to disregard certain changes made in the core blockchain script by the rest of the community. If both parties can rally enough support from stakeholders, both blockchains may subsist, having only in common the blocks history up to the breakup point. This is what happened when the DAO\u2019s bailout patch was released: a significant portion of the community, against the bailout, decided to ignore it and to keep mining the old blockchain, which still exists today as Ethereum Classic [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum#Ethereum_Classic ], with a market capitalisation of about 10% of that of the patched Ethereum as of September 2016.\n\nThey now live as competitors. Despite both blockchains\u2019 code being roughly identical, the split allowed both communities to make a strong statement to the world: Ethereum Classic is truly immutable and will not easily tolerate forks in the future, whereas Ethereum is likely to allow them again and even advertises them as a feature, an additional protection against potential attacks. The split could certainly have been avoided if Ethereum had taken a clear stand in favor of forks when it was first created, and businesses relying on a blockchain will have to decide whether they want to favor systems whose community supports voluntary forks or not. While a forking culture improves the mitigation potential, it can also backfire and overly empower core developers or a few individuals that can more easily impose their personal agenda to all the users of the blockchain.\nImplementation and Monetisation\n\nBeyond the hype, businesses realize that integrating such technologies might be just as hard as the transition to Big Data, both to implement and to extract value. Massive injection of funds will not suffice and some business models might prove more compatible than others, at least initially.\n\nAs decentralisation and getting rid of intermediaries are the main purpose, the blockchain is generally associated with open-source technologies and can appear as an enemy to modern capitalism. However, many successful bitcoin and blockchain startups have shown that the technology can be synergised effectively with paid services; this contrasts strongly with the traditional open-source community\u2014in which users expect an integrally free service\u2014in part because people are already expecting to pay fees due to mining costs necessary to guarantee the reliability of the blockchain. Consulting advice on blockchain can also be offered for governments or organisations that want to leverage the potential of blockchain, and IT consulting firms will quickly need to develop an expertise in that area to respond to the demand. Similarly, companies offering cloud computing services can include Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) into their offering. Universities will also observe a growing interest for both introductory and advanced blockchain courses in their computer science, economics and business degrees.\n\nFirms can also use blockchains to externalise data sensitive components of their applications to decrease their compliance costs and risks of legal liability. If the company does not control the blockchain and only has ownership of the front-end built on top of it, it can only be sued for building the system, not for what becomes of it. This would add a layer of protection for companies operating in an uncertain legal environment. Most of all however, the value of the blockchain for organisations resides in its ability to streamline processes and improve vertical integration of the value-chain by getting rid of costly intermediaries and by simplifying coordination. This will be especially valuable for very fragmented industries that rely heavily on external partners or for companies that trade in a market with a generally low level of trust or high level of uncertainty, such as in many developing countries.\n\nAs for many modern technologies, the early business adopters will probably be start-ups, which can absorb a larger amount of risk and whose dynamism allows for better capacities to adapt to the fast-changing environment of blockchain. Businesses that will be the most at risk are those whose purpose is already to decrease coordination costs, such as banks and law firms, but are also the ones that have the most to gain by adapting. Lawyers for example could expand their services to include smart contracts drafting and bankers could design complex financial instruments living in the blockchain, offering a lot of transparency but requiring the competence of qualified financial advisors to be used appropriately.\n\nWhile the blockchain presents significant opportunities for economic growth, it might often represent more of a threat for individual companies than an opportunity. It will decrease the overall need for both the private and public sectors, in favor of what we call the \u201cautonomous sector\u201d, a complex (somewhat chaotic) network of intertwined DAOs and smart contracts living in the blockchain, over which no one has control. In such cases, the financial incentive for businesses to understand the technology will be more about how to dodge the threat and adjust the offering to remain competitive than about how to extract value out of it. In particular, key differentiation arguments over which the blockchain might win market share are privacy, security, reliability and independence: if companies can improve their products on these characteristics, they might avoid losing the customers who are the most at risk of switching to the blockchain.\n\nMost business uses of blockchain technologies will not require a dedicated blockchain. Use-cases can generally be satisfied easily through smart contracts encoded on networks supporting scripting, such as Ethereum, or by developing applications that rely on existing blockchains, such as a payment systems powered by the Bitcoin.\n\nRecently, private blockchains [ https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/08/07/on-public-and-private-blockchains/ ] have been suggested as alternatives to public blockchains. Contrary to regular blockchains, private blockchains can only be modified or mined by a pre-approved network of computers, with a reading access potentially also restricted. Adding and approving transactions could for example be limited to a consortium of banks who trust each other to a certain extent, with the requirement that each transaction has to be confirmed by at least a certain percentage of the participants. With private blockchains, as the number of participants is limited and known in advance, PoW or PoS can be replaced by proof-of-membership (to a set of hard-coded authorised public keys). Obviously, such systems lose most of the desirable properties that made the blockchain so innovative in the first place (including proof-of-work itself), but they offer an original approach to partially decentralised consensus with cryptographic auditability.\n\nConclusion\n\nMost current implementations of blockchain are unadapted for large-scale solutions. In particular, the Bitcoin community has shown great difficulties to scale and adapt its technologies. The blockchain revolution will not happen overnight, however trends are already emerging\u2014often set by key actors quickly gaining influence\u2014and the Ethereum system is imposing itself as the default option for modern blockchain applications. Further developments should make it highly usable and cost efficient for most business applications.\n\nWhere business will play the most important role in the initial phase of this technology is in providing expertise for both private and public sectors through consultancy services and executive education, in complementing the current cloud computing offering with Blockchain-as-a-Service, in commercialising front-end applications on top of existing blockchains (e.g. e-wallet on top of the Bitcoin or smart contract drafting on top of Ethereum) for business and consumers and in leveraging private blockchains for internal uses. Blockchain should also be considered as a valid threat and direct competitor by many industries for long-term strategic planning.\n\nThe blockchain by itself is of limited value, just as internet and most popular programming languages\u2014all open-source technologies\u2014did not benefit most to their inventors but to those who managed to create value on top of them. The key will be to identify the segments of the value chain of each industry for which the market values decentralisation from the segments for which the market values most the quality of the service and to focus on the latter. Today, practical limitations will orient which technologies we should put on a blockchain, but hopefully future developments such as proof-of-stake will make the blockchain just another database system that companies can choose from.\n\nDisclaimer: all the opinions stated here are my own and not those of my employer.",

Its potential is so great that many believe it will transform the way businesses operate.\n\nThere are a few characteristics that separate Bitcoin from a blockchain that is designed for business. These characteristics include its requirement to be modified to meet the rigorous standards of the industry.\n\nThere is a debate about the value of a token-free shared ledger. In terms of value, it can be used for a wide range of assets, including real estate, private equity, and securities.\n\nBlockchain defined: Blockchain is a distributed, immutable ledger that makes it easier to record transactions and track assets in a business network. An asset can be either tangible (such as a house, car, cash, or land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding).\n\nKey elements of a blockchain\n\n * Distributed ledger technology: All participating nodes have access to the distributed ledger network and its unchanging record of transactions. Transactions are recorded only once with this shared ledger, eliminating the duplication of effort that is common in traditional business networks.\n * Immutable records: After a transaction has been recorded to the shared ledger, no participant can change or tamper with it. If an error is found in a transaction record, a new transaction must be added to correct the error, and both transactions are then visible.\n * Smart contracts: A set of rules, known as a smart contract, is stored on the blockchain and executed automatically to speed up transactions. A smart contract, for example, can specify the terms for corporate bond transfers as well as the terms for travel insurance payments.\nBitcoin thrives due to its anonymity. However, businesses have various requirements that they need to meet to keep their customers and operations running smoothly. One of these is knowing the identities of their customers and dealing with anti-money laundering and KYC compliance regulations.\n\n * Smart contracts are digital contracts that can be used for formalizing digital relationships. They can be executed through blockchain technology and are designed to provide automated transactions.\n * A blockchain for business is achieved through a process known as a selective endorsement. This process allows the network to control who is responsible for verifying transactions.\n * Blockchain is a ledger technology that enables users to track the ownership of goods throughout the supply chain. Its ability to record transactions and provide a complete record allows companies to verify the provenance of their interests.\nBlockchain is the next generation of information technology that will allow people to trust each other. Its decentralized nature enables people to store and transact without intermediaries.\n\nRead more: What is the Difference Between Blockchain And Bitcoin? : BuyUcoin Blog [ https://blog.buyucoin.com/blockchain/what-is-the-difference-between-blockchain-and-bitcoin/ ]",

            "text": "What is Bitcoin?\n\nSimply put, Bitcoin is a currency. Do you know what a Dollar or a Euro is? Good, because a Bitcoin is not much different in principle: you exchange Bitcoins with others in return for goods and services. You can also trade it and speculate on its value just as currency traders do with other currencies.\n\nAt this point, you may be wondering how much a Bitcoin is worth. Well, the answer is it\u2019s worth however much someone is willing to pay for it. At the time of this writing, a single Bitcoin is worth around $10,136, but this value is constantly changing. It may seem odd that there\u2019s no \u201cinherent\u201d value to Bitcoin, but remember that most \u201creal\u201d currencies also don\u2019t have an inherent value. For example, how much is a U.S. Dollar worth? At the time of this writing, someone in Germany would say it\u2019s worth about 0.90\u20ac in Euros.\n\nIndeed, this is the very idea behind fait currencies, such as the U.S. Dollar. Their value is a function of people\u2019s trust in the currency rather than some inherent value. Since the 1970\u2019s the U.S. Dollar has not been tied to the price of gold.\n\nBitcoins do not have a physical form. They are purely a digital currency that are traded online.\n\nWhat benefits does Bitcoin offer?\n\nIn order to understand the benefits of Bitcoin, we need to first think about currencies in general. Bitcoin or otherwise, a currency must have several qualities. Among these qualities are the following two:\n\n1. Currencies must have a limited supply\n2. Currencies must not be easy to counterfeit\nIf condition #1 isn\u2019t met, a currency will have no value. If condition #2 isn\u2019t met, then anyone can make fake copies and spend more than they have.\n\nIn the history of humanity, gold is arguably the most well-known currency. Gold meets both of these conditions extraordinarily well. Gold certainly has a limited supply \u2014 by some accounts, the world supply of gold could fit into a 20 square meter cube. Moreover, gold is nearly impossible to counterfeit since it is an element and it is difficult to create a convincing substitute.\n\nSimilarly, the U.S. dollar shares these characteristics. The U.S. government controls the supply of dollars and takes measures to ensure it is exceedingly difficult to create counterfeit copies of notes and coins.\n\nIn the modern era, however, it is not convenient to use commodities like gold for the purpose of making a purchase. It\u2019s also not convenient to trade physical notes and coins to make purchases; after all, you wouldn\u2019t want to exchange physical bills and coins each time you made an online purchase! So, these days we find ourselves turning to electronic methods such as credit cards, debit cards, and wire transfers.\n\nLet\u2019s think about what happens when we use a debit card at the store: the merchant swipes your card, which results in your bank being contacted to verify whether or not you are authorized to make the purchase. The bank is vouching for you, assuring the merchant that you have the funds needed to pay for the purchase. This step is needed to ensure you don\u2019t double spend your funds. In other words, if you only have $100 in your bank account, your bank should not allow you to spend $100 at one store followed by another $100 at a different store. That would mean you spent twice as much money as you have (i.e., you have double spent your funds).\n\nSo what\u2019s the problem with the current system? The problem is authority. Your debit card company is acting as the single authority that determines if you can spend your funds. Even in the case of physical bills, the government has the ability to control how and where funds move. This may not seem like a big deal, but consider some of the things you\u2019re giving up under this arrangement:\n\n * Limited mobility \u2014 companies and governments can decide how and where you move your money.\n * Transaction costs \u2014 wiring money between banks and between borders is often associated with expensive fees.\n * Control of your funds \u2014 your bank accounts and assets can be frozen for various reasons, effectively making those funds unavailable to you.\n * Reversibility of transactions \u2014 banks have the ability to reverse transactions once they are made.\n * Lack of anonymity \u2014 it\u2019s nearly impossible to remit anything but the smallest transactions anonymously.\nUnlike a government-issued currency or a credit card, Bitcoin has no central authority that controls transactions. Instead of relying on a single authority, Bitcoin democratizes the process by distributing the power across everyone, effectively preventing any one organization from controlling the rules. It does this while ensuring funds cannot be double spent. The ability to prevent double spending without giving control to a single authority is the novel breakthrough introduced by Bitcoin.",

I\u2019m going to absolutely mess with this answer, because I am the thousandth person who isn\u2019t Vitalik Buterin trying to explain something that only Vitalik Buterin and Jack Lu really understands.\n\nI am going to hit misconceptions, in the hope that they illustrate why a minority of the world raves on about how Bitcoin and blockchain are about to change the world \u2013 while the other 80% of people go, \u201chuh?\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the first one. I hate this term \u201cdouble spend problem\u201d.\n\nThe problem with the phrase \u201cBitcoin solves the double spend problem\u201d is\u2026well because Visa does it better. The oft quoted figure is Bitcoin can do 7 transactions per second. Well Visa can peak out at 56k transactions per second. How can this new technology change the world when Visa is beating its ass 800x?\n\nBecause blockchain isn\u2019t amazing because of what Bitcoin is, it is amazing because of how blockchain does it.\n\nBlockchain solves the double spend problem by making a digital asset unique.\n\nImage: I\u2019m mostly grabbing these from the Quora search\n\nVisa is a bunch of banks getting together and filling in a big database. When you move money on existing financial tech rails what is really happening is some guy somewhere is saying \u201cI swear on my heart that some money moved from Mumbai and now it is in Moscow. Look, my PC said so.\u201d\n\nThat is it - and it does it really well. I mean incredibly well. Your bank has probably been hacked. Bitcoin and Ethereum have had flaws exploited. Yeah fraud on Visa is a massive issue, but they have kept the Russian mafia out of their servers. Visa is good at what they do.\n\nMost databases are a list of balances, or facts. British Airways knows I have 6,000 air miles. My auto insurer knows my drivers license.\n\nMaybe they still have all my old transactions and all my old claims, or maybe they delete the ones from ten years ago. Maybe and who cares.\n\nBitcoin cares. Instead of recording the balance, they record every transaction. And when you sum all the transactions you get the balance (or UTXO unspent transaction balance).\n\nAnd every transaction has a digital signature. I\u2019m trying to think of an easy way to explain digital signatures and cryptographic keys, and I\u2019m pretty close to saying there isn\u2019t a way. Here\u2019s the best I can come up with. Imagine my baby always burps 87 seconds after he finishes his bottle. So I hand you my baby to hold and say he\u2019s gonna burp. And he does. No one else can do this trick so you know he\u2019s my baby.\n\nImage: not my baby\n\nI know, I know, terrible example, (he does way more than burp, both ends =%3E same time) but hopefully someone at the back had a laugh, because my jeans are going in the wash.\n\nThese digital signatures, that others cannot copy, means we can put all these transactions out there publicly. We can keep my name out of it, yet we can see whatever that digital thing is, through its entire life.\n\nHere\u2019s a crazy story. You may have heard of Silk Road. Sketchy online market where people used to buy drugs. You will have heard how the FBI busted it. But did you know that they also busted two dirty cops who took bribes from Ross Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road? [1] Basically turning Bitcoins into cash stinks a room out as quick as my kid. Bitcoins are pseudo anonymous. They are the perfect complement to online crime. But they are a terrible way to get US dollars or GBP sterling - quite simply you still need the legit financial system and they are checking. We\u2019ll talk more on these on and off ramps further down. But this is another misconception I\u2019m dying to put a nail in. Cash is dirtier than Bitcoin. If you do crime, you want cash. There\u2019s lots of it. People ignore the cocaine its sprinkled with. You can spend it anywhere. Bitcoins are hard to spend in size, even when they\u2019re legit.\n\nI also had another sad discovery: you are liable for tax on Bitcoin gains in both the US and UK. It\u2019s treated as \u201cnormal property\u201d.\n\nhttps://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-virtual-currency-guidance\n\nSo back to blockchain. Let\u2019s start with this long list of transactions that individuals have proofed as authentically related to them. How does someone add a transaction?\n\nWell you make the transaction and you let it float off into the mempool. That\u2019s just temporary storage. It is up to miners to take it out of there and verify / process transactions into a block. Blocks of transactions are chained, ergo blockchain!\n\nButerin describes Bitcoin as a first to file system. Somebody puts two transactions out there for the same Bitcoin, whichever receiver gets their transaction processed first gets the money. The other person gets a burn.\n\nThe formation of blocks is more interesting than it seems. You wanna hear something crazy, your iphone can probably process as many transactions as Bitcoin. If a blockchain network has one node, then the difficulty is set to zero and it just does it. 7 transactions are not tough.\n\nBut this is blockchain. Blockchain doesn\u2019t want one iphone or one Visa or one Zions Bank processing the transactions. It wants millions. It wants legit superheroes like Elon Musk and Jennifer Lawrence processing transactions, as well as low down crooks like they guys pretending to run your country and mine.\n\nAnd so they make processing costly.\n\nHere\u2019s a question, can I explain proof of work with a farting baby? No, of course I can\u2019t.\n\nImage: winner winner, chicken dinner\n\nIt\u2019s a math problem. But I can do it with a baby race. Imagine ten couples with their babies. Some babies are bigger than the others. They gotta be the favorite. But babies are random. Some will chill out half way along because they want to eat some bug in the grass. Others will burst out crying before they cross the start line.\n\nWhichever couple has the strongest baby will probably win. But its random so even the slowest one will win sometimes.\n\nNow replace baby with computing power and you got proof of work. It\u2019s a random math game. And this is again more interesting than it seems. If this were adults Usain Bold would always win. They made a system where the guy with the biggest PC doesn\u2019t always win.\n\nMiners run this baby race, and if their baby wins, they get a prize. They also get to process some transactions too, but the prizes are what they are really after. Their rewards are going through the roof.\n\nImage: blockchain.info\n\nA big chunk of that is because the price of their Bitcoin rewards are going up. But they\u2019re also getting more outside of that. I ran the numbers and it used to be that if transactions went up 100%, miner rev would go up 8%. A few months ago if transactions went up 100%, miner rev went up 55%. It\u2019s probably even more than that now. The miners are squeezing up the rents on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nEvery transaction takes up space. A few bytes here and a few bytes there. There\u2019s a Max Block Size limit specified in blockchain, that states how much data is allowed in one block. The basics of blockchain processing capacity is blocksize multiplied by time between blocks. And this is the why we have Bitcoin cash and endless arguments about blocksize.\n\nI don\u2019t have a good baby analogy for this so I\u2019m going to keep on walking along. The main point is that blockchain is resource hungry by design. As it stands, one iphone can do 7 transactions a second and all the supercomputers in the world would do 7 transactions a second.\n\nDon\u2019t get hung up on the 7 transactions, it\u2019s a technical decision with a lot of flex. It isn\u2019t even strictly accurate. But the premise is the same, more compute on the network, higher difficultly, same amount of output at the end.\n\nThis costliness is how you allow malicious actors on your network. If they attack your network they have to expend all this cost, or maybe 51% of it. And every time the thing you want to change goes further back, you gotta blitz this cost for longer and longer.\n\nImage: Not an optical illusion\n\nHere is the consensus engine: whichever chain is longer (more blocks) is reality. Whichever chain is shorter is fiction.\n\nI get a little hung up on the term immutable. Arguably it\u2019s a good example of the multi-sided nature of blockchain. Once a transaction is on the chain, there is no amend functionality. However, its technically possible for another chain to emerge as the longest chain and delete the other one. That doesn\u2019t feel immutable to me. But suffice to say blockchain is change resistant.\n\nNow let\u2019s move on to Bitcoin believers versus Bitcoin haters.\n\n#hodlhodlhodl! Bitcoin believers think it will replace the dollar. I\u2019ve put my answer to that deep in here.\n\nhttps://www.quora.com/If-you-invest-100-000-in-the-top-10-cryptocurrencies-what-percentage-do-you-allocate-in-each\n\nBitcoin haters see a bubble, they see no fundamentals, they see a Ponzi scheme.\n\nMe I\u2019m a Bitcoin tourist. Bitcoin is a bubble, but it is not the bubble where the real price is zero in my opinion. Personally, I think it could be worth the current price at the tail end of my lifetime. Perhaps it\u2019ll drop to sub $1k on its way there. Maybe it\u2019ll get to $100k before then.\n\nThe way I look at Bitcoin: imagine you are super rich. Like Scrooge McDuck. You hire a bunch of lawyers and you set up a trust in the Bahamas and a corporate entity in Delaware and basically nobody touches your money. You are not evading tax, you are legally avoiding tax and keeping people out of your business. When you spend it you pay sales tax on it, but until then its protected.\n\nThat is Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is giving people with modest amounts of savings the opportunity to act like a rich person.\n\nImage: fake it till you make it\n\nNow, many holders of Bitcoin are there for the lottery like opportunity. Hell I\u2019ll put my hand up. But the two sides to the price rise is that yes, the price rise is drawing in lots of new users, but its undoubtedly hurting its practical usage for transactions. [2]\n\nIf you want Bitcoin to be a currency you probably want it to stop going up.\n\nI\u2019m going to slip some bad news in here.\n\nHere is ShapeShift, a company that swaps cryptocurrencies, getting caught lying about how they make money. Companies do this all the time, say one thing and make the money elsewhere.  [3] But this is blockchain guys, we can look at what you are doing in real time.\n\nWhen it comes to crypto, for every Vitalik Buterin and Charlie Lee that makes you confident the best people are working in crypto, there are many others that are here to simply exploit as many as they can.\n\nIf you want to really see some ugly rumors, you should check out bitfinex\u2019ed on twitter. [4]\n\nI agree with bitfinex\u2019ed that tether are car wash tokens. His dynamite accusation is that the exchange Bitfinex are printing them to gas up the Bitcoin price.\n\nI could just go on and on with this stuff. For example, pump and dump scams are endemic across the cryptocurrency space. [5] Groups of traders coordinate through Telegram and buy small coins, driving up the price dramatically. These moves take on a life of their own as others rush in. And then the original buyers sell out and move on.\n\nThis works because so many coins mostly don\u2019t trade. Small trading volumes despite the big market capitalizations.\n\nCrypto really is the Wild West of finance.\n\nLet\u2019s jump to the traditional finance industry. The traditional finance industry is potentially going to implement their own version of blockchain \u2013 that looks nothing like blockchain. They will likely drop proof of work and have trusted nodes that they control. They\u2019ll keep the distributed, the crypto, the unique asset aspects. They\u2019ll add on some funky bells and whistles like gmail labels and node specific channels. These guys are gonna adopt blockchain and when they do it will be big.\n\nThey won\u2019t adopt Bitcoin, except to sell it as an asset class. The killer problem for them is that the whole business is now about Know Your Customer (KYC). They won\u2019t let you swap Bitcoins into dollars unless you send them your passport.\n\nDoes this mean Bitcoin is doomed?\n\nNo way. This is the reason why I stick by my line that 1-3 cryptocurrencies are going to be a store of value in the medium term. As long as rich people keep hiring lawyers to set up trusts then there\u2019s a demand for crypto.\n\nWhy only one to three?\n\nImage: the Bitcoin of the past\n\nLet\u2019s think about air miles. Air miles are a digital currency. Maybe they suck because you fly United and they put you in fight club last time you went to New York. But air miles also suck because you cannot change them into dollars. Buying air miles with dollars is crazy. A store of value requires that somebody is spending dollars to buy that crypto. If the only buyers of your crypto are Bitcoin holders, then at some future point Bitcoin is the store of value and your little coin is\u2026like\u2026a real business doing what it originally set out to do.\n\nI feel like the intensely tribal behavior of many crypto owners, indicates how most of them know there can only be a few winners too.\n\nThese few crypto, they will be the basis of the future alternative finance sector. It will be pseudo anonymous and it will do lots of things that rich people pay for all the time. It will even be advantaged as an ecosystem versus traditional finance because its currency will be part of the coding. Traditional finance looks like it won\u2019t have a native cryptocoin, so basically the money has to move off chain. This is called the cash leg by central bankers. Certainly there is talk on FEDcoin [6] , but I suspect it\u2019ll only be for the banks to use. Frankly, governments like the fact that banks can print money\u2026and once you got a FEDcoin in the hands of regular Joes, then why would you use a bank?\n\nHere\u2019s my punchline: Crypto hodlers are right that crypto is big and going to get bigger. Sensible naysayers are likely right that ultimately we are going to get an ugly bubble like reckoning. Parallel to that the deployment of blockchain has barely got started.\n\nJust think about all the junk we got that is written on paper or printed on plastic. All of that can now exist digitally and not be copied as easily as the whole of your music collection.\n\nBest of luck everybody.\n\nIf you want to read 25 pages on why Bitcoin might be a technological prototyping signal with respect to distributed ledger, here\u2019s the link:\n\nhttps://ssrn.com/abstract=3198530\n\nThis would suggest that maybe the recent down move is driven by a loss of confidence in adoption, but also suggests perhaps we can have another up cycle as adoption hype firms up again.\n\n\n1.

The faster it\u2019s received and the more accurate it is, the better. Blockchain is ideal for delivering that information because it provides immediate, shared and completely transparent information stored on an immutable ledger that can be accessed only by permissioned network members.\n\nA blockchain network can track orders, payments, accounts, production and much more. And because members share a single view of the truth, you can see all details of a transaction end-to-end, giving you greater confidence, as well as new efficiencies and opportunities.\n\nThere are three reasons why you need to know about Blockchain:\n\n1. Blockchain technology doesn't have to exist publicly. It can also exist privately - where nodes are simply points in a private network and the Blockchain acts similarly to a distributed ledger.\n2. Financial institutions specifically are under tremendous pressure to demonstrate regulatory compliance and many are now moving ahead with Blockchain implementations. Secure solutions like Blockchain can be a crucial building block to reduce compliance costs.\n3. Block-chain technology is broader than finance. It can be applied to any multi-step transaction where traceability and visibility is required. Supply chain is a notable use case where Blockchain can be leveraged to manage and sign contracts and audit product provenance.\n4. It could also be leveraged for votation platforms, titles and deed management - amongst myriad other uses. As the digital and physical worlds converge, the practical applications of Blockchain will only grow.\n5. The exponential and disruptive growth of Blockchain will come from the convergence of public and private Blockchains to an ecosystem where firms, customers and suppliers can collaborate in a secure, auditable and virtual way.\nBlockchain technology is used for many different purposes, from providing financial services to administering voting systems.\n\n * Cryptocurrency\n * Banking\n * Asset Transfers\n * Smart Contracts\n * Smart Contracts\n * Voting\nIf you're looking for a better career I personally suggest to go for blockchain technology certification\n\nIf you are wondering where to begin this journey? Then you should check the blockchain for business certification\n\nBut you first check if the institute has goodwill in the market and if this blockchain certification online is accepted globally or not. Check the review before applying.\n\nFrom my experience I personally recommend to do certificates in blockchain certification from the GSDC website online.\n\nAs I have one reference for a blockchain for business certification I found one course on google they provide certificates\n\nThe certification cost is also affordable here.\n\nThe blockchain for business certification costs $200. This certification is from GSDC. You can check the syllabus on their official websites.\n\nCost : $200\n\nLocation: Online\n\nThe GSDC certification bodies provide blockchain for business certification online and it is valid and accepted globally.\n\nMany of the reputed company employees have done this courses from here and give good responses and rated the blockchain certification\n\nTo get this certification you have to pass the blockchain certification online course exam from GSDC Institution.\n\nGSDC's certification is aimed towards sharing a deep understanding of all the advanced blockchain for business certification courses\n\nThe purpose of internet of things certification qualification is to confirm that a candidate has sufficient knowledge and understanding of the benefits of this certification.",

Its efficiency in securing data and creating a \u201cchain\u201d with no previous sections makes it eligible for several uses like finance or any multi-step transaction that requires traceability and visibility. So, experience with programming languages like Python, C#, C++, the fundamentals of OOPS, flat and relational databases, data structures, web app development, and networking can give you high salary jobs in blockchain development.\n\nhttps://qwikskills.com/top-technological-trends/78947/\n",
